# lock-only-passable-tests: interphase locks only acceptance tests that can pass, each into its own MSP; mitosis loses its wall-clock limits

## Goal

Spec 3 of the unattended-runs program: interphase checks every locked test for feasibility inside the planned write-sets before locking, renders one check-author per MSP so each MSP locks only its own tests, and mitosis plants, locks and gates per MSP and has no wall-clock limit, with every process non-interactive and git dead-peer detection on.

## Done when

- [ ] c1 interphase pull request open, bound with ccd_pr, Auto-Fix on
- [ ] c2 mitosis pull request open, bound with ccd_pr, Auto-Fix on
- [ ] c3 final report lists each pull request, its unproven criteria and its assumptions

## Where things stand

The interphase build is running; mitosis planned it as two MSPs, lock-feasibility and feasibility-instructions. The mitosis spec per-msp-locks-no-limits is rendered (seven criteria, four Steps, one MSP) and its one spec review is running.

## Next step

Read the interphase build's JSON result and start review round 1 of each MSP; fix the mitosis spec reviewer's issues once, then hand that spec off.

Needs: D1.

## Decisions in force

- D1 Hand-off boundary: build the interphase spec lock-only-passable-tests with mitosis 0.11.0 from feat/lock-only-passable-tests, running plan, build, review and ship in this session.

## Open risks

- R1 The standards text appended to worker rules says to give every wait a time limit, against both specs' no-caps intent; the interphase Workers received it, so review checks lock_feasibility.py for any limit, and the mitosis run's worker-rules.txt overrides that line. Bears on c1.

## Settled, do not reopen
